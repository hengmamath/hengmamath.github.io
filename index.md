## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at School of Mathematics, Peking University. I am in the [probability group](https://pkuprobability.com) and my advisor is Prof. [Yan-Xia Ren](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm). I graduated from Shandong University in 2020. 

<u> I am on the postdoc job market during Fall 2024. <u>

Here are my [CV](assets/files/CV_Heng_Ma.pdf) and a [research statement](assets/files/ResearchStatement_HengMa.pdf), last updated in Oct 2024. 

## Research Interests

I'm interested in probabilistic models, particularly those that incorporate tree and graph structures. I have been working on the following topics 

- **Erdős–Rényi random graphs:** recovery problem.

- **Branching random walks:** maximum, martingales(partition functions), and level sets.

I am trying to learn and work on more interesting subjects, e.g., random trees and random networks, universality class of log-correlated fields, Gaussian multiplicative chaos, etc.

## News
- I will be a visiting phd student at UNC, chapel hill from Sep 2024 to Mar 2025, hosted by Prof. [Shankar Bhamidi](https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu).
