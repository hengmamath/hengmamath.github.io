## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at School of Mathematics, Peking University. I am in the [probability group](https://pkuprobability.com) and my advisor is Prof. [Yan-Xia Ren](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm). I graduated from Shandong University in 2020. 


## News
- From Sep 2025, I will be a postdoc at [Technion probability group](https://probability.technion.ac.il) hosted by Prof. [Oren Louidor](https://sites.google.com/view/louidor/). 



## Research 

I'm interested in probabilistic models, particularly those that incorporate *tree  structures*.
I am trying to learn and work on more interesting subjects, e.g., 
- random trees and random networks, 
- 2D (discrete) Gaussian free field and universality class of log-correlated fields, 
- Gaussian multiplicative chaos.
