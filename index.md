## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at School of Mathematics, Peking University. I am in the [probability group](https://pkuprobability.com) and my advisor is Prof. [Yan-Xia Ren](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm). I graduated from Shandong University in 2020. 

## Research Interests

I'm interested in probability models particularly those that incorporate tree structures. I have been working on the following topics 

- **Erdős–Rényi graphs:** shotgun assembly problem.

- **Branching random walks:** maximum, martingales(partition functions), and level sets.

I am trying to learn and work on more interesting subjects, e.g., universality class of log-correlated fields, Gaussian multiplicative chaos, random graphs and random networks, etc.

## News

- **[Jul. 2024]** I will attend the 2024 CRM-PIMS Summer School in Probability at Montreal in July 1-26.
- **[May. 2024]** I will give a talk at Southern University of Science and Technology in May 30, Shenzhen.
