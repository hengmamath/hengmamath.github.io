## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at School of Mathematics, Peking University. I am in the [probability group](https://pkuprobability.com) and my advisor is [Yan-Xia Ren](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/index.htm).

## Research Interests
 I’m interested in probability models background in physics, biology and computer science,  particularly those that incorporate tree structures. I have been worked on 
- **Erdős–Rényi graphs:** shotgun assembly problem. 
- **Branching random walks:** maximum, martingales(partition functions), and level sets

I am trying to learn and work on more interesting models, e.g., Gaussian free fields and log-correlated fields, Gaussian multiplicative chaos, random walks, etc.

## News
- **[Jul. 2024]** I will be attending the 2024 CRM-PIMS Summer School in Probability in Montreal.
