## About Me

I am currently a postdoc at [Technion probability group](https://probability.technion.ac.il) hosted by Prof. [Oren Louidor](https://sites.google.com/view/louidor/). I obtained my Ph.D. at [probability group in Peking University](https://pkuprobability.com) under the supervision of Prof. [Yan-Xia Ren](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm) in 2025.  


<!-- ## News
- From Sep 2025, I will be a postdoc at [Technion probability group](https://probability.technion.ac.il) hosted by Prof. [Oren Louidor](https://sites.google.com/view/louidor/).  -->



## Research 

I'm interested in probabilistic models, particularly those that incorporate tree structures. I am trying to learn and work on more interesting subjects, e.g., 
- 2D (discrete) Gaussian free field and universality class of log-correlated fields, 
- Gaussian multiplicative chaos.
- random trees and random networks,
